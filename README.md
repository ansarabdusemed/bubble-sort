Bubble Sort Algorithm: sorting algorithm twhere the largest values move up to the top of the array or list

Logic:  1. Start looping with a variable called i to the end of the array towards the beginning
        2. Start inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning until i - 1
        3. If arr[j] > arr[j+1], swap those two values 
        4. Return the sorted array
